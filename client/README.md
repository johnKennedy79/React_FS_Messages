# React Full Stack Messages

I built a message board where once loged in the user can view all messages stored on the data base in desending order so newest first they can leave a new message once the server has recieved the new message the page refreshes so that the user can see it as well.
All messages a colour coded and labeled by category  
the user has a form to create new categories of their own and assign a colour to them
and a form to send new messages in the categories that are available
they can also filter the messages by category on the search page

I tried to add like and delete buttons to each message but unfortunatly the functions do not work seting information and deleting information in the database is something I would like to get a better understanding of as I had the same issue with the visitores book I made a few weeks ago

I found passing props and pramaterers a little confussing and feel that I could spend anouther week going over what I have just learned and getting a better grasp of the subject

I did however manage to set up very basic user signup and login pages with regex passwords the hardest thing I found was linking the user name to a new message by their user id

I would like to get feed back on the delete and like functions and why they are not working also how I can keep the information needed in the dynamic pages I tried to do some reading on use Context but found it confusing and thing it would have helped greatly on this project

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
